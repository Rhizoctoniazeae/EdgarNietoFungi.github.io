My current research focus on the study of risk of fungicide resistance emergence in _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ known as white mold, a fungal pathogen that causes disease outbreaks on soybean. Keen, the aims are  to determine fungicide sensitivity of populations from soybean; evaluate the effect of different fungicide applications on the sensitivity of field populations; and characterize the population structure and genetic diversity populations from soybean throughout the North Central United States and Mexico.

My thesis title is "Fungicide Sensitivity and Population Structure of _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ from Soybean in
the North Central United States and Dry Bean
in Mexico"
